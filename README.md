# About Me

Hi, I am Breeje and Welcome to my repository!

I Discover Faulty States in Smart Contracts. I've explored various projects in various domains like DeFi, games, and NFTs, finding important issues along the way. My main aim is to contribute as much as I can in making the blockchain ecosystem more secure for everyone.
