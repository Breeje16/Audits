# About Me

Hi, I am Breeje and Welcome to my repository!

Being an independent smart contract auditor, I help protocols ensure the security and reliability of their smart contracts. With a strong background in programming and a deep understanding of blockchain technology, I have helped many protocols identify and mitigate potential security risks before they cause harm. I have audited various types of smart contracts, including DeFi platforms, Games, NFT marketplaces, and more.

My work has resulted in the identification of vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks, MEV Attacks, Logical Issues, Oracle Integration Issues, DOS Issues and other critical issues. By identifying these vulnerabilities and providing recommendations on improving smart contract security, I have helped blockchain projects to improve their security and protect user funds.
