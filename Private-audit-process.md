# Private Audit Process

## Questions to the Project

1. What's the clear scope of smart contracts - nSLOC?
2. Does the project have well-written specifications & code documentation?
3. What is the code test coverage percentage?
4. Have you had any audits so far?

Based on the answers to the above questions, we can discuss the payment amount and deadline.

## Vulnerability Mitigation Review

After the agreed-upon time has passed, the project will receive the audit report. A single iteration of a "mitigation review" will be executed by me, free of additional charges, to verify that your fixes are correct and the code is secure.

### Important Notes for the Mitigation Review

- For any questions or clarifications on the vulnerabilities/recommendations in the report, you can reach out to me on the intended communication channel.
- Changes to be reviewed should only include mitigation for the reported issues.
- In the case that mitigation are too difficult to implement or more than one iteration of reviews is needed, then this is a special case that can be discussed independently of this review.

## Other Questions

1. What is your preferred communication channel (Discord, Twitter, Telegram)?
2. Are you okay with me publishing the audit report after you apply fixes?
3. Are you okay with me being transparent with our work, findings and payment?

## Disclaimer

"Audits are a time, resource and expertise bound effort where trained experts evaluate smart contracts using a combination of automated and manual techniques to find as many vulnerabilities as possible. Audits can show the presence of vulnerabilities but not their absence."
